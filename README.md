# Welcome to My Pokemon App
***

## Task
-The goal of My Pokemon App is to create a simple  functional web application that displays a list of Pokémon fetched from a public API.
Users can search for Pokémon, view their images in a grid layout, and click on a specific Pokémon to see detailed information. 
The app also provides navigation to return to the main Pokémon list.

## Description
 I developed My Pokemon App using ReactJS and styled it with CSS for a user-friendly interface. The app fetches data from the PokéAPI, allowing users to:

-View a list of Pokémon with their names and images displayed in a grid format.
-Search for Pokémon by name using a search bar placed at the top of the page.
-Click on a Pokémon to view its detailed information, including its stats, abilities, and more.
-Navigate back to the main Pokémon list with a stylish back arrow.
